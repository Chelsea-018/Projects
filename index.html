    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is Chelsea Ezenduka. </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I am a native of Achina, in Anambra state. I base at Trans-Ekulu, Enugu. I finished secondary school last year and I'm waiting on UNN for an admission with the purpose of studying medicine.
       I'm currently attending a school "Codecity" at Nsukka where I heard of this program, so apperently I stay at Nsukka for the time being. </p>
    <h2>Expectations</h2>
    <p>Having said my purpose is studying medicine at UNN(Parents Choice), I decided to learn coding during this Holiday to keep me busy. Hearing about Upskill I decided to register with the purpose of being a well known web Developer, and being able to do some online job..if that's possible. </p>
    <p>I expect to be not just a boring developer but to be an outstanding hacker(Positive) having been through Upskill. I'd do anything to be a full time hacker..that's practically another reason I chose programming over the summer. From this "Codecity" school I attend, I've struggled to understand coding very well because teachers are somewhat busy to always be there for us newbies and so Upskill program is all I have left. I was very excited when I heard this program was free, if only they could also teach hacking processes for a pleasurable reason, that would be more overwhelming.</p>
    <p>Thank you</p>
